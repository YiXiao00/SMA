# Evaluation
By taking the consideration of the usage of our application. The main user group should be targeted on families. And the main goal of our application is to enable users to manage their electricities more reasonably and environmental-friendly. With a online device anyone in a family can easily gain access to the control panel of the devices at home and taking a continuous monitoring on the energy consumption and some other detailed datasets. 

One of the methods we used to evaluate our product was to interview a potential customer of the service. 
We first interviewed Andrew, a student, who has smart devices in his home.

# Do you find the system easy to use?

"Yes it is very simple. Getting an account set up was easy and quick. Once I logged in there was a very clean dashboard. I also liked how it was a web application so that I can manage my devices anytime anywhere, and don't need to have any downloaded software."

# What more would you like to see out of it?

"Well since smart devices are quite a high end product, I would have expected a nicer looking system. I think it could have looked sleeker and less plain."


Andrew's feedback was very useful. He confirmed that the product was working as expected, and was able to provide some feedback as to what we should work on next. We are taking his advice now and making the application look better using CSS.

# Second interviewee

The second interviewee is a very importand family member, a grandma of one of our team member, who does not know technology so much but can use mobile phones well.

# How do you like this system?

"This system facilitated my life a lot, that I do not need to walk through the living room to turn on the dish washer and air conditioner. Since I have some disease with my legs, so I am looking forward to see this system come out."

# How do you think about the navigation of our system, is it easy to use?

"To be honest, I do not really understand how to manage my devices and how can I make a appointment with the system."

Grandma's oppinion is about improving the navigation and praticallity about our system. To achieve this, we have improved some functions and add explanations to certain functions.
