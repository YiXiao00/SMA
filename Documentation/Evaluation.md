# Evaluation

One of the methods we used to evaluate our product was to interview a potential customer of the service. 
We interviewed Andrew, a student, who has smart devices in his home.

# Do you find the system easy to use?

"Yes it is very simple. Getting an account set up was easy and quick. Once I logged in there was a very clean dashboard. I also liked how it was a web application so that I can manage my devices anytime anywhere, and don't need to have any downloaded software."



# What more would you like to see out of it?

"Well since smart devices are quite a high end product, I would have expected a nicer looking system. I think it could have looked sleeker and less plain."



Andrew's feedback was very useful. He confirmed that the product was working as expected, and was able to provide some feedback as to what we should work on next. We are taking his advice now and making the application look better using CSS.
