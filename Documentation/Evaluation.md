# Evaluation
In order to evaluate our project properly, we considered what methods would be most effective so we could tailor our methods for our project. The main aim from a consumer end is to allow users to manage their devices and tasks, and data (such as electricity consumption). This meant UI would be very important. We wanted to take feedback from people so we could create a user manual, making it so no one could get confused. We also wanted to evaluate how well the project fulfilled Alex's need, of being flexible and able to be adapted for a number of devices. Finally, we also wanted to evaluate how well the technical functions worked.

We decided due to these three needs, a variety of testing methods would be used. We would speak to a number of people, including our client to get some feedback on how they felt about our project. We would ask questions concerning user interface, ease of use, how bug-free their experience had been and their thoughts on it as a whole. Interviews are fantastic opportunities to get feedback live, as you can see how someone is engaging with the software. UI problems , for example, are incredibly easy to notice when someone else is using the software. The form would also mean we could ask specific questions and follow up if there were ambiguous answers - as opposed to an online survey, which could lead to some "incomplete data".

We would also implement unit testing, showing that our project worked as intended with suitable error checking and minimal side effects. We do not expect everything to be perfect, so we would like to assess ourselves and understand which parts have been done well and which could be improved a lot. Unit testing is a fantastic way to ensure the project is reliable and useful. Whilst implementing it, we realised we should have made it a significant part of our project from the start. It was always our intention to develop testing alongside our project, and this is something that unfortunately fell to the wayside.

# Interview One

I spoke to my friend Eva, in an attempt to establish what she liked about the project and try and get some valuable feedback. I did not give her any instructions, only informing her it was a project for managing Smart Homes.

The signup and login were fine. She appreciated the choice to use cookies rather than have to constantly re-enter the username and password. She noted there was no way to delete her account from the UI. She did note the different styles between the sign up page and the actual dashboard, something that was more
