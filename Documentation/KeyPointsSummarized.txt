She liked the slick and professional UI, and how each device had it’s own page. She expressed that we could stylize each individual page more, using CSS and animations. A mobile app was mentioned, and this is something we would develop as a long-term goal. The user experience was confusing at first, showing the need for a user manual. I noted her confusion between two types of task, she suggested merging them and making a more flexible method of creation. This is a good idea to simplify the user experience. The overall response was positive, but the need for greater functionality was vocalised.
