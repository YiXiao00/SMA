# Alex Mavromatis
Alex works as a research associate for the high performance network group at University of Bristol. He proposed the initial project and has been our guide for both a general outline of the project and what technical elements should be utilised (eg. he informed us that we should use MongoDB for this project). He is our main client for this project, and we have been continually consulting with him to ensure a successful project is completed to his design. Alex has an investment not only in a good project being made but the data being collected properly such that it can be utilised for research.

# Theo Tryfonas
Theo is a reader in Smart Cities in the department of Civil Engineering. His research focuses both on Smart Cities and the IoT. He also proposed the initial project and though we have not met with him as frequently as we have met with Alex, his insights and ideas have been incredibly useful in helping us to start the project. Theo also has an investment not only in a good project being made but the data being collected properly such that it can be utilised for research.

# Samsung
Since many of the devices used within the Smart Homes are Samsung, it is incredibly important our middleware is created in such a way that properly looks after Samsung usage data. Not only are we collecting data, we are offering remote functionality to the devices that makes them even more useful - but we need to be careful with security and ensure the IoT data is sent correctly.

# University of Bristol
Both of our clients we have been meeting with are members of Research Groups at the UoB, so we have a responsibility to them through our clients.

# Smart Home Owners
Smart Home owners rely on us building a functional piece of software with a simple to understand and easy to use front end. They rely on the consistency of our software to allow them to plan around it - they can take full advantage of our software if it is always available. Furthermore, they also put trust in us to take care of their data properly - storing passwords and identifying information securely and ensuring that only they have control over Smart Devices in their home.
