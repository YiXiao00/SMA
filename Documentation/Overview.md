# Project
We have been working on a Smart Homes Application, able to manage and control multiple devices attached to multiple homes. These devices can have tasks scheduled, recurring tasks set up and can be controlled manually through a user dashboard. Our software is also able to connect to FiWare, an IoT platform allowing for more control of the devices and more potential uses of
our program.

# Client
Our client is Alex Mavromatis, a Senior Research Associate at the High Performance Network group. We have been working closely with Alex over the project, gaining valuable insight into smart devices and homes and how our project would work. We have created the project with Alex's guidance, regularly meeting with him and his feedback has been an instrumental part of the development process.

# Problem
The main problem we are trying to solve is creating flexible middleware that can be used on as many devices as possible. Different smart devices can have different ways of being controlled, and most people have a range of brands of device but don't want to use multiple applications in order to control them. We have tried to create a very modular project, such that support for new devices can be added easily without causing any problems. We also wanted to make sure the project had a simple front end, and could just be used from a web browser rather than requiring the user to install an application.

Smart Homes are a growing market. 81% of Americans favour homes with smart features, and 62% claim security systems are the top benefit. People want a simple way to interact with these devices - 72% want a home with voice capabilities. Household penetration was 7.5% in 2018 and is expected to hit 19.5% by 2022 - a large increase. The need for a simple easy and accessible smart interface is clear.

# Consideration
The most important part of our project in terms of sustainability is ensuring it can be easily updated. It would be foolish to assume that the landscape of Smart Devices will not change in the next 6 months,
let alone the next few years. Our project handles devices, tasks and even cookies entirely in it's own databases - ensuring continuing functionality is not contingent on outside software or databases.
